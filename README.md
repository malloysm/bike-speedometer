# Bike-Speedometer
Arduino Bicycle Speedometer that displays speed, trip and total distances, and trip and total times. Saves distance and time data after powered off so a cyclist can pick up where they left off without leaving the speedometer on.

Developed by Sean Malloy, Andrew Koopman, and Max Knece for ECE 303 at Miami University
